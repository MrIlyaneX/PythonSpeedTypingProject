# Python Speed Typing Project

This repository contains a desktop-web application developed by a team of four students from Innopolis University. The project was created as part of an elective course and aims to provide a platform for practicing speed typing and learning blind typing techniques.

## Project Overview

The Python Speed Typing Project is a desktop-web application designed to improve users' typing skills through a series of interactive exercises. The application incorporates the principles of speed typing and offers a user-friendly interface for practicing and tracking progress.

## Features

- **Speed Typing Exercises**: The application provides a variety of exercises to improve typing speed and accuracy. Users can choose from different difficulty levels and practice typing paragraphs, sentences, or random words.

- **Blind Typing Techniques**: The application includes exercises specifically tailored to help users learn and master blind typing techniques. These exercises focus on typing without looking at the keyboard, enhancing muscle memory and typing efficiency.

- **Performance Tracking**: Users can track their typing speed, accuracy, and progress over time. The application records and displays various metrics, allowing users to monitor their improvement and set personal goals.
