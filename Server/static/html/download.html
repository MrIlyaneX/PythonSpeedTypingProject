    <p>Our typing speed application project is designed for entertainment purposes, without a solid scientific focus. While similar resources already exist on the Internet, they often need improvement, with users complaining about limited functionality, excessive advertising, a complex interface, and inflexible settings.</p>
    <p>To address these shortcomings, we conducted a small study and identified the areas for improvement. As a result, we proposed several new tools. We outlined the project's objectives, which included developing a user-friendly application, creating a website with performance records, establishing a backend infrastructure with a database, and implementing API requests.</p>
    <p>To efficiently manage the project, we divided the tasks among the team members. We recognized three significant areas of focus: front-end development, database management, and setting up a server for API requests. Two team members were assigned to handle the design aspects and part of the app functionality, while another team member took responsibility for the database, and a fourth member focused on configuring the server.</p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Our team:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Anastasia Pichugina: responsible for the database</li>
        <li>Elena Tesmeeva: responsible for design and frontend</li>
        <li>Polina Pushkareva: responsible for design and frontend</li>
        <li>Ilia Mistiurin: responsible for the server, connection with the database, monitors the work of the entire team</li>
    </ul>
